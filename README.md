# E-Commerce-Platform-Analysis
This is an analysis of the sales of an anonymous e-commerce platform from Pakistan between 2016 and 2018. This project explores how the data is cleaned and interpreted, the data is then analysed and visualised to draw conclusions. I aimed to find ways the platform can improve its business performance.

Step 1) Data Cleaning 
- Refer to Python file and SQL script
- Each column was analysed carefully, examined for null values, anomalies, standardisation errors and outliers and were rectified

Step 2) Exploratory Data Analysis
- Refer to SQL Script and Python file
- These were the main conclusions and areas of improvement drawn from the analyses
  1. The top 10% of customers in terms of total spent, and number of orders were identified.
     These **customers should be incentivised thriugh seasonal discounts and loyalty discounts**, and perhaps **marketing messages can be regularly sent** to these customers
     For customers who order particular items on a seasonal basis, reminders can be sent at the approximate date of purchase.
  2. The platform has low customer retention, with approximately half having ordered more than once. This indicates customer dissatisfaction or incentives to use other platforms to 
     shop. This indicates a low customer retention rate. Firstly, **reviews aand surveys should be conducted**, not only about the items but the user experience of the platform itself to 
     gain insights into customer pain points.
     Additionally, loyaltly points and benefits should be incorporated to encourage customers from using the platform again.
